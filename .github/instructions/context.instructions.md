we are building a tool which helps user drop their notes, pdfs, wordfiles, text files into a single location for easy access and organization.
The user should be able to easily upload and manage their files within this centralized location.
The user should also be able to create folders and organize their files within this location.
User will be able to search for their files using keywords or tags.
The user should be able to create folders and subfolders to further organize their files.
The user should be able to rename, delete, and move their files and folders as needed.
The storage will be AWS S3.
We will use authentication using firebase.
The application will be built using next js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
The user name should be able to change username, email, and password using firebase.
Analyze this color pallet :
#000000
#9929EA
#CC66DA
#FAEB92
and use the color palette to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the application.
The frontend should be futuristic and icons and animations used should be smooth and modern.
All aws and firebase credentials should be stored securely in a .env file and not exposed in the frontend code.
Do not over engineer the application keep it simple and make sure the user can upload files easily using web browser, mobile devices and also have an option to drag and drop files into the upload area.
